Z8L programs run on Zynq ZTurn-7020 with PDP-8/L code loaded (contains device code and 8/L simulator).
You can pass the '-?' option to get them to print usage information.

automated test programs:

    ./z8lcmemtest               test DMA circuits - tests 4K core memory and extended memory
                                    runs on real PDP and simulator
                                    test MEM circuits if extended memory testing enabled

    ./z8lpiotest                test PIO circuits - uses DMA circuits to write program to PDP's memory
                                    runs on real PDP and simulator

    ./z8lsimtest                test 8L sim (hold simit on, pulse fpgareset, pulse nanotrigger),
                                    CM (always clears enable, set dma field), XM (always sets enable, enlo4k; all IOs tested)

    ./z8lxmemtest.armv7l        always sets enlo4k, reads & writes extmem block

    ./z8lsim testos8dpack.tcl   test RK8JE controller and DMA
    ./z8lsim testos8dtape.tcl   test TC08 controller and 3-cycle DMA

    ./z8lsim run-d01b.tcl ...
        z8llib                  always sets e_simit (simulator), e_nanocontin (fpga continuous clocking)
