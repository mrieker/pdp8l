Setup:

    ZTURN/ZTURN36 board installed in slot 36 B,C,D with ZTurn-7020 plugged in
    ZTURN/ZTURN35 board installed in slot 35 B,C,D and piggy-backed to ZTURN36
    ZTURN/ZTURN34B and ZTURN34D boards installed in slot 34 B,D and piggy-backed to ZTURN36,35
    PIPAN8L/PCB3 or 4 installed on backplane pins of slot 1 and connected to ZTURN36 via I2C

    5V power supply plugged into ZTurn board and powered on
     - optional but recommended so ZTurn doesn't get powered from PC via USB cabke
    ethernet cable plugged into ZTurn board and connected
     - optional but recommended to allow more than one terminal window at a time
    USB cable from USB connector closest to ZTurn SDCard connected to a PC
     - baud rate is 115200

Initially, use ZTurn serial console to set up IP address (if ethernet connected):

    Log in as root
        edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf to set eth0 IP address and default gateway address
        reboot
    Now should be able to ssh to that IP address

Before doing any of the below, do:

    cd pdp8l/pipan8l
    ./z8lreal [options...]      turns on fpga code to access real pdp (not simulate)
                -entty03        use fpga console tty
                                 - use ./z8ltty to access console tty
                                 - must unplug tty boards from pdp (M706 and M707)
                -nobrk          PDP-8/L does not have BREAK option hardware
                                 - forces all low 4K memory accesses to fpga memory
                                 - can leave core memory plugged in

Light rolling demo:

    cd pdp8l/pipan8l
    ./z8lpanel doubleroll.tcl
        must have some switches (like 5 & 6) on
        indicates number of steps before reversing

Kaleidoscope demo:

    cd pdp8l/pipan8l
    ./z8lpanel kaleid.tcl e

Music demo:

    cd pdp8l/music
    ./playrand.sh real
        loads ~/music-rkab0.rk05 file in RK05 drive 0
        toggles in OS/8 bootloader then starts it
        does a DIR to get list of music files
        runs MUSIC then passes song files in random order

    Take cover off PDP-8/L backplane pins
    Put small insulated AM radio on top of backplane pins
    Tune to 600-700 kHz

OS/8 Basic games:

    cd pdp8l/pipan8l
    ./z8lpanel bootos8dpack.tcl

        DIR
        R BASIC
            OLD
            BLKJAK
            RUN
            ...
            BYE

EDU25 Basic:

    cd pdp8l/edu25r
    ./test.sh real
        types in and runs simple HELLO program

    then to access main tty:
        ../pipan8l/z8ltty -cps 960 -upcase
        control-\ when done

    to access other 2 ttys, on 2 other screens:
        cd pdp8l/pipan8l
        ./z8ltty -cps 960 -upcase -dc02 0
        ./z8ltty -cps 960 -upcase -dc02 1

On separate screens:

    cd pdp8l/pipan8l
    ./z8lpanel -status          displays front-panel lights
    ./z8ldump                   displays dump of fpga registers

Tutorial:

    programs of interest
    pass -? option to print help text

        z8lpanel - access front panel via i2c bus
            also can access fpga control bits
            can process tcl scripts for testing and booting
            can load rim and bin files
            help command lists commands

        z8ltty - connect to a tty controller, process tty i/o
            example: ./z8ltty -cps 960 -upcase      by default, accesses primary tty controller
            press control-\ when done

        z8lrk8je - load disk files in rk05 drives, process rk05 i/o
            example: ./z8lrk8je -loadrw 0 ~/os8-rkab0.rk05 &
            leave it running in background so it can process rk05 i/o

        z8lptr - load file in high-speed paper tape reader, process reader i/o
            example: ./z8lptr -text somefile.txt
                     ./z8lptr somefile.bin
            exits when whole file read by pdp
            press control-C to terminate earlier

        z8lptp - load file in high-speed paper tape punch, process punch i/o
            example: ./z8lptp -text somefile.txt
            press control-C when done punching from pdp
